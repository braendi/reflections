When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when i want to share it with other developers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- because - if the remote is public - anyone could commit something on the remote, and i want decide myself, what to include
