What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- a .git directory is created, to tell git, that my directory is under version control from now on

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- it contains only files "in transfer". maybe i can still reconsider my decision and remove it from there before i commit. or maybe it is a kind of 'local' commit before i expose my changes to everyone.
